### What is this site?

This site is trying to describe the metagame of [Battlerite](https://www.battlerite.com) as well as possible, through statistics
from the best players in the game. Hopefully it can help newer players get a decent setup for their character without 
having to figure out everything for themselves.

### How were these stats made?

These statistics were made by looking at the replays from the last 7 days of all Champion and above ranked solo players in Battlerite. 


### How are statistics about damage, protection etc calculated?
These statistics are computed averages for each round played with a given build.
