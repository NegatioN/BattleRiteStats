Site made with Jekyll Now

Site is developed on `master`-branch, and published live on `gh-pages`-branch.


# TODOS
* top heroes sorted by usage in each mode
* searchable players (and their most used heroes + builds)
* * https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/jekyll-search-using-lunr-js/
* * https://arcath.net/2016/02/setting-up-lunr-js-in-jekyll/
* Try to categorize each build as Offensive / Control / Support based on relative stats for each round of a build.

* colorize statisics by comparing to average for a champion. Ex: hero-avg=1000, build avg=1100 means green colored stat.

* only push to gh-pages after successful test-suite? https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/

* Try different ad-stuff. Add more padding around ads as well. It's a bit too prominent now?
