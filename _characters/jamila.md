description: "A young assassin from the Shadowblade clan, Jamila suddenly found herself\
  \ the new leader after the death of her mother, the previous matriarch. As the youngest\
  \ leader in the clan\u2019s history, some call her too inexperienced and undeserving\
  \ of the title. Determined to silence those detractors, Jamila enters the arena\
  \ to prove her mastery of the Shadow Arts."
