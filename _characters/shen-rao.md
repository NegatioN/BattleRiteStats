description: Shen Rao was once The Dragon of Storms, revered as a deity for his majesty
  and power. In his arrogance, he defied the dark powers of the Void but he was defeated
  and sealed within a human body, reduced to a fraction of his former strength. In
  battle he utilizes remnants of his dormant powers, raining down lightning and engulfing
  his enemies in violent thunderstorms.
