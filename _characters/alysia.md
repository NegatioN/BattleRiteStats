description: From the frozen north comes the ice sculptor Alysia. Her power allows
  her to wield ice with both grace and deadly precision. She can damage and freeze
  her enemies from a distance, while shielding her allies with ice. Obsessed with
  shapes and form, she left her icy fortress of solitude to seek inspiration in the
  arena.
