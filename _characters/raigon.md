description: Raigon, formerly the crown prince of Quna, is a skilled melee fighter
  trained in two-handed swordsmanship and martial arts. He hopes to break the evil
  spell cast upon his father and return home. For now, the arena serves as a decent
  place to find work and set the wheels in motion for his retaliation.
