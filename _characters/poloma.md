description: Poloma uses shamanic powers to guide life and spirits alongside her protector
  and loyal creature, Toki. A dark disturbance among souls has put Poloma on a new
  path, leaving her safety and home behind. Driven by her burning curiosity and extraordinary
  senses, Poloma now seeks her answers in the arena.
