description: "Ancient folklore speaks of Thorn, the destructive apparition. Using\
  \ its network of thorn-covered roots, it would whip, rupture and drain the life\
  \ out of any living thing indiscriminately. Some say Thorn is just a story to keep\
  \ kids out of the forests at night, others say it is an old lie used as a cover-up\
  \ for misdeeds. Thorn\u2019s presence in the Arena is both a mystery, and a very\
  \ bad omen."
