description: An elite sky ranger from the secluded, invisible city of Enza. Many years
  of rigorous combat training using Magi-tech weaponry makes Destiny an agile and
  deadly force to be reckoned with. Fed up with the strict regulations of living in
  Enza, Destiny often escapes the city to blow off some steam and have fun in the
  arena.
