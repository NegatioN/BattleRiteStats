description: When the famous theatre troupe "The Phantomime Masquerade" disbanded
  after a series of tragic events, their magnificent magician Zander vanished without
  a trace. Known for his unparalleled perfection in card trickery, teleportation,
  duplication and transformation, this distinguished illusionist has now returned
  from the dead to turn the otherwise ceremonial arenas world-wide into spectacular
  revelries.
